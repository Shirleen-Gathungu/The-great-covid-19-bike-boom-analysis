The weekly trail count data is downloaded from RTC's Eco-Counter dashboard.
"Each week was compared across years, from 2019 to 2020, with a focus starting on week 12 or March 16."
"The week of March 16 was selected for analysis as this was the timeframe when many organizations in the U.S. began encouraging or mandating telework policies, and states imposed travel restrictions and encouraged social distancing to slow the spread of the pandemic. The analysis was intended to determine how changes in social behavior would affect trail counts nationwide."
"RTC's analysis shows that year over year, counts increased across all counters spread throughout the country."
"For the week of March 16, 2020, trail counts increased by 193% compared to 2019."
"For the week of March 09, 2020, trail counts increased by 94% compared to 2019."
"Counts increased by 75% between the week of March 9, 2020 (210k)and March 16, 2020 (367k). That is greater than the week-over-week increases recorded in 2019."
These findings support conclusions that the pandemic and associated travel restrictions may have had a significant impact on trail usage nationwide.
